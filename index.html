            Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. 
            General opinion’s starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don’t see that. 
            It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it’s not particularly dignified or newsworthy, 
            but it’s always there – fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends,
            old friends. 
            When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, 
            none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge – they were all messages of love. 
            If you look for it, I’ve got a sneaky feeling you’ll find that <strong>love actually is all around.</strong>

                        E-Writer is project about writing with just hand gestures , using IOT
                        and machine learning. It will recognize the hand gesture with the help
                        of small device which has accelerometer sensor and it will be
                        connected to machine with the help of Arduino.

                        provided by coursera. In this project i have worked upon data
                        analysis libraries as Pandas and Numpy and for data visualization
                        I have used libraries as seaborn and plotly.
